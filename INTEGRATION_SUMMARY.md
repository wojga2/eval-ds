# Tau2Bench Preamble Patch - Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Done

Modified the `run-telecom-eval.sh` evaluation pipeline to automatically apply the preamble patch without any manual intervention.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `run_bee_with_patch.py`

**Location**: `experiments/scripts/run_bee_with_patch.py`

**Added**:
- New `apply_preamble_patch()` function that:
  - Imports `tau2bench_preamble_patch` module
  - Patches `get_chatbot_system_prompt()` to intercept system prompt generation
  - Patches `Tau2BenchTask.__init__` to load `preamble_patch` from config
  - Automatically applies patches before bee runs

**Integration**:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Apply MCP server patch (existing)
    apply_patch()
    
    # Apply preamble patch (NEW!)
    apply_preamble_patch()
    
    # Run bee...
```

### 2. Updated Documentation

**Location**: `experiments/failures/README.md`

**Updated**:
- Status to "Implemented & Integrated"
- Added complete monkeypatch solution section
- Documented how the integration works
- Listed all solution components

## How It Works

### Execution Flow

```
./experiments/scripts/run-telecom-eval.sh --focused --num-tasks 20
    ↓
run-bee script
    ↓
run_bee_with_patch.py
    ↓
Two patches applied:
    1. MCP server patch (existing)
    2. Preamble patch (NEW!)
    ↓
Tau2BenchTask.__init__ runs
    ↓
Reads preamble_patch from config
    ↓
get_chatbot_system_prompt() called
    ↓
Preamble injected between </instructions> and <policy>
    ↓
Model receives enhanced system prompt
```

### Patch Injection

The `preamble_patch` content from TOML configs is automatically injected into the system prompt:

```
<instructions>
{original instructions}
</instructions>

<preamble_patch>
{your custom instructions from TOML}
</preamble_patch>

<policy>
{domain policy from GCS}
</policy>
```

## Usage

### No Changes Required!

Simply run your evaluation as normal:

```bash
./experiments/scripts/run-telecom-eval.sh --focused --num-tasks 20
```

The preamble patch is **automatically applied**.

### Configuration

Configs are already set up with `preamble_patch` field:

- `experiments/configs/tau2bench_telecom.toml`
- `experiments/configs/tau2bench_telecom_focused.toml`

To modify the patch content, edit the `preamble_patch` field in these files.

## Testing

Unit tests are in place and passing:

```bash
cd /home/wojciech_cohere_com/dev/eval-ds
uv run pytest tests/test_preamble_patch.py -v
```

**Result**: 8/8 tests passing ✅

## Solution Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `tau2bench_preamble_patch.py` | Core monkeypatch logic | ✅ Complete |
| `run_bee_with_patch.py` | Integration & auto-apply | ✅ Integrated |
| `tau2bench_task_wrapper.py` | Reference implementation | ✅ Created |
| Config TOML files | Preamble content | ✅ Updated |
| Unit tests | Validation | ✅ Passing (8/8) |

## Verification

To verify the patch is working:

1. Run an evaluation:
   ```bash
   ./experiments/scripts/run-telecom-eval.sh --focused --num-tasks 3
   ```

2. Look for these log messages:
   ```
   ✅ Patched Tau2BenchTask to use local MCP servers:
      - airline:  http://127.0.0.1:8100/mcp
      - retail:   http://127.0.0.1:8101/mcp
      - telecom:  http://127.0.0.1:8102/mcp

   ✅ Patched Tau2BenchTask.__init__ for preamble_patch config loading
   ✅ Patched get_chatbot_system_prompt for preamble injection
      (Preamble patch will be loaded from task config)
   ```

3. Check the results - models should now understand tool boundaries correctly

## Key Benefits

✅ **Zero modifications to apiary codebase**
✅ **Automatic application** - no manual steps
✅ **Config-driven** - easy to update patch content
✅ **Well-tested** - comprehensive unit tests
✅ **Maintainable** - clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Run a validation** to confirm the model behavior improves
2. **Monitor logs** for reduction in "Invalid tool name" errors
3. **Compare metrics** with previous runs to verify fix effectiveness
